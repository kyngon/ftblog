Born in the 80s, I live and work in Italy as a software developer.

I enjoy:
  - reading books: mostly fantasy, SF and mistery.
  - reading comics: both occidental and manga.
  - gaming online: games such as World of Warcraft and Path of Exile.
  - gaming offline: old LucasArts point'n'click adventure games, such as The Secret of Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, etc.
  - making origami
  - taking pictures with my mirrorless (but I'm too lazy to correct and enhance them digitally, so I keep them unmodified - shame on me)
  - watching anime
  - drinking beer with friends
