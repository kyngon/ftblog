&lt;p&gt;A family is similar to a city in some aspects. You know all about the small parts of the family that is closer to you, but when you start discovering about distant relatives and their parts of the family, it’s like exploring a new part of the city that you never knew existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exploration brings new names in the family, new stories, new relationships. And it’s fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family tree is the map that you create along the way. And just like a city map, it can help you visualize your family, understand relationships between distant family members, but also remember facts and memories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, next time you’re at a distant relative’s wedding, you’ll remember names much more easily! No more awkward situations where someone tells you they are your cousin but you never heard about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A family tree visualization can enclose a small or big number of family members - you decide what story you want to tell! And so there will never be only one family tree. You can create one for the family centered around you, one centered around your grand-grand-grandparent where you will be one of the many grandchildren, or you can create one centered around another family member, and it can be a beautiful present for that person if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When starting this project, I decided to create not a single family tree, but a database with all the information that I could find, and see where it would lead me to.
Once the database is there, creating a tree is all about extracting part of that data and putting it into some form more pleasing to the eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next posts I will describe the solution I chose to use to keep the database.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Moris</name></author><category term="[&quot;blog&quot;]" /><category term="blog" /><category term="genealogy" /><category term="family-tree" /><summary type="html">Have you ever been lost in a big city, all streets looking alike and trying to find your way out of the maze and back to known parts?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Blog Introduction</title><link href="http://familytreehowto.com/blog/blog-introduction/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blog Introduction" /><published>2021-01-25T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-01-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://familytreehowto.com/blog/blog-introduction</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://familytreehowto.com/blog/blog-introduction/">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my blog about genealogy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea for this blog came to me at the end of 2020, as a way to document what I discovered during that year about genealogy, family trees, looking for information about other family members online, compiling a database with all these information, and finally, when this database is satisfiably filled, using the information to create not one, but many different family trees as different views on the same big family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2020 was a terrible year because of COVID-19. For a lot of people, it brought also a huge change in working and living habits. I used to work in an office in the city center. Suddenly, in February, my company closed the office and asked everyone to work from home as a temporary measure. This measure lasted for the whole year and after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working from home at first did not seem so bad. I am a tech enthusiast, so I did not have issues moving all my activities home from a technical point of view. Even if I had never worked from home before, I had plenty of keyboards, mouses, monitors, cables. So the move had almost no impact on my ability to work.
But working from home and the isolation that accompanied it - especially in the first months - had a huge impact on me. I was in need of a new project that could distract me and motivate me but also keep me engaged with other people in a way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building a family tree has interested me for a very long time, but I never managed to overcome the initial lack of knowledge. First of all: I had ideas about how to draw a family tree, but how precise should it be? How much of the family should it comprehend? What about the family members I didn’t know? How should I fill missing data?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions always stopped me from starting - until now. I met with a relative who has always had a deep interest in family matters, and who showed me his handwritten notes with dates of birth and marriages for a lot of family members. Some where even arranged in some 3-4 pages of handdrawn small family trees for the portions of the family that he knew about.
I asked if I could take pictures to start from that and build something myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so it began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that point on I was hooked. I scanned the internet for any useful information that would lead me to some new data to add. I asked relatives what they knew, and listened to beautiful stories I never knew about. I learned about my grandparents’ time in the war, and about my grandma’s uncle who went in the USA more than 100 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I also chose a way to store and organize all the information I found and visualize it all in a family tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog I am going to write what I found out searching and completing my family tree, so that you will be able to use it as a starting point for your own search. Many of the hints I am going to give are of course tailored on my own experience and preference, but I decided to write as well about thing I ended up not choosing, so that you can follow that path if you so prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you all good luck in your research! Sometimes it feels like you are at a dead end, but don’t stop looking! I can assure you it’s such an enormous joy to see the family tree complete day after day, week after week, under your eyes!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Moris</name></author><category term="[&quot;blog&quot;]" /><category term="blog" /><category term="introduction" /><summary type="html">Welcome to my blog about genealogy!</summary></entry></feed>
