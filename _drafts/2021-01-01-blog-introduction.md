Welcome to my blog about genealogy!

The idea for this blog came to me at the end of 2020, as a way to document what I discovered during that year about genealogy, family trees, looking for information about other family members online, compiling a database with all these information, and finally, when this database is satisfiably filled, using the information to create not one, but many different family trees as different views on the same big family.

2020 was a terrible year because of COVID-19. For a lot of people, it brought also a huge change in working and living habits. I used to work in an office in the city center. Suddenly, in February, my company closed the office and asked everyone to work from home as a temporary measure. Well.. this measure lasted for the whole year and after.

Working from home at first did not seem so bad. I am a tech enthusiast, so I did not have issues moving all my activities home from a technical point of view. Even if I had never worked from home before, I had plenty of keyboards, mouses, monitors, cables. So the move had almost no impact on my ability to work.
But working from home and the isolation that accompanied it - especially in the first months - had a huge impact on me. I was in need of a new project that could distract me and motivate me but also keep me engaged with other people in a way.

Building a family tree has interested me for a very long time, but I never managed to overcome the initial lack of knowledge from many points of view.

First of all: I had ideas about how to draw a family tree, but how precise should it be? How much of the family should it comprehend? What about the family members I didn't know? How should I fill missing data?

These questions always stopped me from starting - until now. I met with a cousin of my mother, who has always had a deep interest in family matters, and who showed me some handwritten notes he kept with dates of birth and marriages for a lot of family members, arranged in some 3-4 pages of handdrawn small family trees for the portions of the family that he knew about.
I asked if I could take pictures to start from that and build something myself.

And so it began.

From that point on, for months, I searched on the internet and asking relatives, and choose a solution to store all that information. 

In this blog I hope to write what I found out searching and completing my family tree, so that you will be able to use it as a starting point for your own search.

I wish you all good luck in your research! Sometimes it feels like you are at a dead end, but don't stop looking! I can assure you it's such an enormous joy to see the family tree complete under your fingers!
