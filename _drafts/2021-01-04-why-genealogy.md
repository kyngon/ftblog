Have you ever been lost in a big city, all streets looking alike and trying to find your way out of the maze and back to known parts?

A family is similar to a city in some aspects. You know all about the small parts of the family that is closer to you, but when you start thinking or discovering about distant relatives and their parts of the family, it's like exploring a new part of the city that you never knew existed.

The exploration brings new names in the family, new stories, new relationships. And it's fascinating.

The family tree is the map that you create along the way. And just like a city map, it can help you visualize your family, understand relationships between distant family members, but also remember facts and memories.

A family tree can enclose a small or big number of family members - you decide what story you want to tell! And so there will never be only one family tree. You can create one for the family centered around you, one centered around your grand-grand-grandparent where you will be one of the many grandchildren, or you can create one centered around another family member, and it can be a beautiful present for that person if you wish.

For that reason, when starting this project, I decided to create not a family tree, but a database with all the information that I could find, and see where it will bring me.
Once the database is there, creating a tree is just about extracting part of that data and putting it into some form more pleasing to the eye.

In the next posts I will describe the solution I chose to use to keep the database.
