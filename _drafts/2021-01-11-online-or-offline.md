If you try searching online for family tree software, you'll fine a lot of websites that offer online creation and display of a family tree for you.

I researched some of the possibilities that they offer and they are indeed very interesting, very easy to use, and integrated with search functionality that allows you easily to insert information you just found in the tree.
I will review some of those that I like the most in some following posts, so that you can decide which one to use if you want to go the online way.

After long pondering, I decided not to make my family tree on one of these websites because of the following reasons.

1. Privacy concerns. A family tree on a public website makes sense if you decide to make your family tree public as well. This can help people looking for family members discover and connect with your family tree. But what if other family members don't want to have their names and data publicly displayed online? Should you go asking everyone what you can or cannot publish? I didn't like the idea.

2. Publishing format. The online family tree is a beautiful way to browse and display the family tree on a monitor. But what if you wanted to print it? Some websites offer printable formats but those are not customizable in almost any way. Some also offer to print and send you a limited number of levels of your family tree but again - they decide how to display it.

3. Future availability. Websites are born and die every day, and so do companies behind them. Even if I'm fairly sure the bigger ones will still be there in 10+ years, do I want to take the risk?

4. Exports and backups. These websites offer great import capability to be able to take data in all the forms that you had them stored elsewhere. But when it comes to export, they give you very poor choices, if they allow exports at all.


On the other hand, the reasons why I ended up using an offline database that I had to copy manually on each computer where I wanted to use it are the following.

1. No privacy issues. It's like having a notebook or a word document stored. Noone will complain while it's on your pc.

2. The chosen program has great compatibility with export programs to backup your data, and many options to export the data as you prefer it. Horizontally, vertically, big fonts, small fonts, pictures, ... And even if you don't find a nice format for your prints, having a generic, accepted export means that you can find a website or another program that has a better graphic output, and quickly import what you collected in your database, only to print the result with the new program.

3. Even if websites and programs change, we can still read files in 30 years old formats, so a backup of our database in a generic format will likely be usable even after decades. Also, the currently most used export format for genealogy data is saved in a human readable form. This means that even if there were no program to use the data, a human would still be able to read all the info inside and copy/convert the data manually.


If you, like me, find benefits in an offline database, in the next post I'll describe the program I ended up using.

If you still prefer the website idea - that has a lot of benefits, like social sharing, connecting with others in the world, easier user friendly interfaces - for you I will show some of the best and biggest websites, both commercial and free, that offer all of these benefits and much more.
